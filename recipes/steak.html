    <h2 class="h2-style">Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="bg-color bg-padding">
      <li class="li-style">1 (2 pound) butcher's steak (hanger steak)</li>
      <li class="li-style">1 tablespoon clarified butter</li>
      <li class="li-style">â…” cup chicken broth</li>
      <li class="li-style">2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar</li>
      <li class="li-style">2 tablespoons cold butter, cut into cubes</li>
      <li class="li-style">salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps For Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Remove all silver skin and extra fat from the steak. Carefully cut out
        the connective tissue that connects the 2 halves of the steak,
        separating the whole into 2 long pieces. Cut lobe of meat from one half
        (it's a piece that is slightly separated from the larger half). Then cut
        each of the 2 larger halves into 2 steaks each. Sprinkle with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat skillet over high heat. Add clarified butter when pan is hot, then
        place the steaks in the pan. Reduce heat to medium. Cook until browned
        on all sides, firm, and reddish-pink on the inside. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read 125 degrees F (52
        degrees C), a total of about 12 minutes. (This cut of meat has a sort of
        triangular shape, so about 4 minutes per side.) Transfer to a warm plate
        and tent with foil to let steaks rest and allow temperature to rise to
        130 degrees F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour stock into skillet set over medium heat. Stir with a wooden spoon
        scraping up the browned bits from the bottom. When brownings dissolve
        and liquid begins to reduce after 2 or 3 minutes, reduce heat to low.
        Add accumulated juices from the meat, balsamic vinegar, and butter
        chunks. Cook and stir until butter melts. If liquid has reduced too
        much, add a splash of broth. Taste to check if sauce needs a bit of
        salt.
      </li>
      <li>To serve, slice steaks and spoon pan sauce over them.</li>
    </ol>
