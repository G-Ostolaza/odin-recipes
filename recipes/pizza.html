    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (1 pound) loaf frozen bread dough, thawed</li>
      <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
      <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
      <li>8 ounces sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
      <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon fennel seed</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps For Cooking</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Lightly spread 2 tablespoons butter on all cut sides of the buns and
        quickly toast them on a griddle, large skillet, or under the broiler, 1
        to 2 minutes. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape ground beef into 4 burgers, a little larger than the size of the
        bun, as they'll shrink slightly when cooked. Season with salt and
        pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place burgers on the griddle or into a large skillet, and cook over
        medium heat to your preferred doneness, 7 to 10 minutes, flipping once.
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
        least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Place a slice of cheese on each
        burger, and cook until cheese starts to melt, about 1 more minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, liberally spread about 1 tablespoon of butter on the top half
        of each toasted bun. Place the burger with cheese on the bottom bun, and
        add your favorite toppings. Place the buttered top half on the burger,
        and serve warm.
      </li>
    </ol>
